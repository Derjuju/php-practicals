Practical #1
============

The goal of this practical is to learn how to work with a VM and Vagrant first,
by playing with the PHP language. You should focus on understanding how things
work rather than trying to doing things by yourself, especially because most of
the work is already done. Be sure to understand everything before starting the
exercises!

Once you have a working VM, SSH into it:

    $ vagrant ssh

Interactive Command Line
------------------------

### 1. Hello World

PHP embeds a nice interactive shell that is often underused, because developers
don't really know about it. However, in most cases, it is really handy as it
allows you to quickly write and execute PHP. Unfortunately, it is not a real
**R**ead-**E**val-**P**rint-**L**oop (REPL) per se.
[Boris](https://github.com/d11wtq/boris) is a real and powerful REPL for PHP.
Facebook has its own interactive shell too: [phpsh](http://www.phpsh.org/).

In the following, we will use the default PHP interactive shell though:

    $ php -a
    Interactive shell

    php >

Type:

    php > echo "hello world";

Now, hit `enter` to execute your first line of PHP. You should get the following
result:

    hello world

The PHP command line is also able to execute PHP code directly from the command
line thanks to the `-r` option:

    $ php -r 'print "hello world\n";'
    hello world

This is particularly useful when you have to deal with OS restrictions. For
instance, Composer, the PHP package manager, uses
`php -r "file_get_contents('...');"` to download files on Windows machines
because `curl` or `wget` don't exist by default.

Now, execute the following line:

    php > echo sprintf("Hello %s\n", "Votre prénom");

Hit `enter`:

    Hello Votre prénom

### 2. Variables

Declare your very first variable:

    php > $a = 1;
    php > var_dump($a);

The result should be:

    int(1)

Now, declare two variables:

    php > $a = 1;
    php > $b = 3;
    php > printf("%d + %d = %d", $a, $b, $a + $b);

The result should be:

    1 + 3 = 4

Working with strings is easy:

    php > $b = "foo";
    php > var_dump($b);

The result should be:

    string(3) "foo"

`print_r()` is another function to print variables:

    php > $b = "foo";
    php > print_r($b);

The result should be:

    foo

`var_export()` is a function that formats a variable:

    php > $b = "foo";
    php > echo var_export($b);

The result should be:

    'foo'

### 3. Include

In host machine, create `DOCROOT/projects/tp1/shell.php` and insert:

``` php
<?php
$foo = 1;
```

Then, from interactive shell in virtual machine:

    php > var_dump($foo);   // foo is not defined

You should get the following result:

    NULL

Now, include your file:

    php > include "/var/www/tp1/shell.php";
    php > var_dump($foo);   // all code in file is executed

The result should be:

    int(1)


Cli Programs
------------

> All cli programs MUST be run into the VM.

It is possible to execute PHP code directly from the command line by giving
`php` command a file as first argument:

    $ php file.php

You can also use the `#!/usr/bin/env php` shebang and make the file a script à
la shell script:

    $ echo '#!/usr/bin/env php' > /path/to/your/php/file.php
    $ chmod a+x !$

**Note:** changing file permissions MUST be done in the host machine, not in the
VM because of VirtualBox filesystem. An alternative would be to enable NFS
between the host and the virtual machines, but it might cause issues.

Now, you can execute your script that way:

    $ /path/to/your/php/file.php

### Exercises!

#### Hello, World!

Write "Hello, World!" to the console using a PHP script that can be executed by
running the following commands:

    $ php hello.php
    // should output: "Hello, World!"

    $ ./hello.php
    // should output: "Hello, World!"

#### User Interactions

Write a script that takes your name as first argument, and print:

    Hello, <your name>!


Client and Server
-----------------

### MVC Architecture

Let's create a few directories and files:

    $ mkdir -p $DOCROOT/projects/tp1/{public,model,view}
    $ touch $DOCROOT/projects/tp1/public/cities.php $DOCROOT/projects/tp1/model/cities.php $DOCROOT/projects/tp1/view/cities.php

``` php
<?php
// DOCROOT/projects/tp1/public/cities.php

// include model
include __DIR__ . '/../model/cities.php';

// include view
include __DIR__ . '/../view/cities.php';
```

``` php
<?php
// DOCROOT/projects/tp1/model/cities.php
$cities = array(
    [ "id" => 1, "name" => "San Francisco", "country" => "USA"       ],
    [ "id" => 2, "name" => "Paris",         "country" => "France"    ],
    [ "id" => 3, "name" => "New york",      "country" => "USA"       ],
    [ "id" => 4, "name" => "Berlin",        "country" => "Germany"   ],
    [ "id" => 5, "name" => "Bamako",        "country" => "Malia"     ],
    [ "id" => 6, "name" => "Buenos Aires",  "country" => "Argentina" ],
    [ "id" => 7, "name" => "Santiago",      "country" => "Chile"     ],
    [ "id" => 8, "name" => "Bombay",        "country" => "India"     ],
    [ "id" => 9, "name" => "Vancouver",     "country" => "Canada"    ],
);
```

``` php
<!-- DOCROOT/projects/tp1/view/cities.php -->
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
        <title>All Cities</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>All Cities</h1>
        <table>
        <?php foreach ($cities as $city) : ?>
            <tr>
                <td><a href='/tp1/city.php?id=<?= $city['id']; ?>'><?= $city['name']; ?></a></td>
                <td><?= $city['country']; ?></td>
            </tr>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
        </table>
    </body>
</html>
```

Open
[http://localhost:8080/tp1/cities.php](http://localhost:8080/tp1/cities.php).

### Add A Dynamic Controller

Let's define a page to present a city:

``` php
<?php
// DOCROOT/projects/tp1/public/city.php
include __DIR__ . '/../model/cities.php';

/**
 * render a 404 page
 */
function page_not_found()
{
    header("HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found");
    include __DIR__ . '/../view/404.html';
    die();
}

// retrieve id from url parameter
cityId = $_GET["id"];
if (!isset(cityId) || !is_numeric(cityId) || !isset($cities[cityId])) {
    // No id given or invalid id
    page_not_found();
}

// retrieve city from dataset
$city = $cities[cityId];
// define some more variables
$title = sprintf("City %s", $city["name"]);

// include view
include __DIR__ . '/../view/city.php';
```

``` php
<!-- DOCROOT/projects/tp1/view/city.php -->
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
        <title><?php echo $title ?></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1><?php echo $city["name"] ?></h1>
        <footer>
            <a href="/tp1/cities.php">Back to list</a>
        </footer>
    </body>
</html>
```

``` html
<!-- DOCROOT/projects/tp1/view/404.html -->
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
        <title>Not found</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>404 not found</h1>
        <footer>
            <a href="/tp1/cities.php">Back to list</a>
        </footer>
    </body>
</html>
```

Open
[http://localhost:8080/tp1/cities.php](http://localhost:8080/tp1/cities.php),
and click on some cities.

Open
[http://localhost:8080/tp1/city.php?id=-1](http://localhost:8080/tp1/city.php?id=-1)
and see the result.

### Exercises!

#### Filter Cities By Country

Add a link to the country list and create a page for a country, listing all its
cities.

#### Data Store

Read cities from a CSV file:

``` csv
1;San Francisco;USA
2;Paris;France
3;New york;USA
4;Berlin;Germany
5;Bamako;Malia
6;Buenos Aires;Argentina
7;Santiago;Chile
8;Bombay;India
9;Vancouver;Canada
```

You might need [filesystem related
functions](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.filesystem.php), and
the [explode](http://fr2.php.net/manual/en/function.explode.php) function.
