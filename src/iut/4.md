Practical Work #4
=================

The goal of this practical work is to implement a simple content negotiation
layer in your &micro;Framework, and to make your application a bit more REST
compliant.

1 - Meet Composer
-----------------

You will now use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to manage your project, and
its dependencies.

In your project, create a `composer.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "require": {
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": { "": "src/" }
    }
}
```

Now, run:

```bash
vagrant@vm $ composer install
```

### Replace Your Autoloader With Composer's One

When you run `composer install`, it installs project's dependencies but also
generates an autoloader file in `vendor/autoload.php`. That one is optimized,
and probably better than yours. Moreover, it's automatically generated, and you
don't need to waste your time on that part.

In `app/app.php`, replace the autoloader with `vendor/autoload.php`.

You can safely delete the `autoload.php` file you wrote in the previous
practical work.

### Fixing The Test Suite

If you run the test suite, it should fail because the autoloader setup has
changed. Edit the `tests/boostrap.php` file, by replacing its content with:

``` php
$loader = require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
$loader->add('', __DIR__);
```

Be sure to understand what it does.

Edit the `tests/boostrap.php` file, by replacing its content with:

2 - Content Negotiation
-----------------------

Your application should be able to serve resources in:

* `HTML` using a template;
* `JSON` encoded data.

The HTML part has been done in the previous practical work.

The JSON part is what you have to do now. This part is the **API** part of your
application. So you have to follow the REST conventions such as proper status codes,
and so on.

Your implementation will also accept parameters encoded in:

* `application/form-url-encoded`;
* `application/json`.

The `application/form-url-encoded` is used when you submit a HTML form.


### Guessing The Best Format To Return

It's _Request_'s responsability to resolve the best format to serve, so we need
a `guessBestFormat()` method in this class.

[Negotiation](https://github.com/willdurand/negotiation) will help you to get the
best format from headers by handling content negotiation. The `Accept` header
**could** be found in `$_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT']`.

Thanks to this new method, it is now possible to render different content based
on the best fit.

Create the `guessBestFormat()` method as specified. Rely on the Negotiation
library if you think it's worth using it ;-)

The Response
------------

To fit the HTTP protocol, every response should contain at least:

* a `Content-Type` header to describe the content;
* a status code to give feedback on what happened;
* the content (or body) of the response.

That makes a lot of things to handle, it cannot all fit into the `App` class. A
`Response` class will be in charge of the response configuration:

```php
<?php

namespace Http;

class Response
{
    private $content;

    private $statusCode;

    private $headers;

    public function __construct($content, $statusCode = 200, array $headers = [])
    {
        $this->content    = $content;
        $this->statusCode = $statusCode;
        $this->headers    = array_merge([ 'Content-Type' => 'text/html' ], $headers);
    }

    public function getStatusCode()
    {
        return $this->statusCode;
    }

    public function getContent()
    {
        return $this->content;
    }

    public function sendHeaders()
    {
        http_response_code($this->statusCode);

        foreach ($this->headers as $name => $value) {
            header(sprintf('%s: %s', $name, $value));
        }
    }

    public function send()
    {
        $this->sendHeaders();

        echo $this->content;
    }
}
```

Update the `process()` method in the `App` class to use this new class. The PHP
function `call_user_func_array()` can be useful.

**Important:** it should be possible to return either a string as you used to do
**or** directly a `Response` object.


Formatting Your Data The Right Way
----------------------------------

HTML rendering is achieved through your template engine. Rendering your data in
other formats is called _serialization_. Serialization is the process of
converting a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored.

The serialization is handled by a Serializer. This serializer can be as
simple as the `json_encode()` function or you can use the [Serializer
Component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/serializer.html).

Use the new methods created in the `Request` class, and return a `Response` with
the right content/headers, in each controller's function. You can rely on the
Serializer component, but using `json_encode()` is easier.

You can use an anonymous function to factorize some code, or extend the `Response`
class. Just saying...

**Important:** always set the right status code to the response. It has been
described in the previous practical work.
