Practical Work #5
=================

Write a SQL script named `app/config/schema.sql` to create a `statuses` table.
This script MUST be written in SQL that is also MySQL compliant. It should be
repeatable, so be sure to add a check if the table already exists for instance.

Your VM has [MySQL]() installed, and running with the default settings. A
database named `uframework` is configured for user `uframework` (password:
`passw0rd`), with all privileges.

Executing your SQL from the command line can be done that way:

``` bash
vagrant@vm $ mysql <database> -u<user> -p<password> < app/config/schema.sql
```

Be sure to replace `<database>`, `<user>`, and `<password>` with the appropriate
values. There is no space between `-u`/`-p` and their corresponding values, this
is not a mistake!

Udate your Model Layer to manipulate a database rather than a file. In order to
do that, you have to:

* use [PDO](http://php.net/manual/book.pdo.php);
* use a `Connection` class as described in class;
* use the `Connection` instance to execute queries.

You can create another class which implements the `Finder` interface, and
replace the instance of `JsonFinder` in your code, by an instance of this new
class. Choose an appropriate name for such a class.

The `Connection` should be instantiated in `app/app.php` only once. That way,
the whole configuration part is located in a single place.

The `find*()` methods will not use the `executeQuery()` method, you will have to
write your own logic to return the data (_hint:_ `FETCH_ASSOC` can become your
new friend).

You MAY need to update the templates.

Now, check everything still works.


The Model Class
---------------

Create a `Status` class which represents a single status if it is not done yet.
Be sure to write clean code (ie. avoid setters).

For dates, use `DateTime` instances. Optional values are **nullable** in PHP:

```php
class Foo
{
    /**
     * @var string
     */
    private $required;

    /**
     * @var string|null
     */
    private $optional;

    public function __construct($required, $optional = null)
    {
        $this->required = $required;
        $this->optional = $optional;
    }
}
```

Use this class in your project.


The Data Mapper
---------------

Create a class that implements the **Data Mapper** design pattern. This class is
responsible for persisting and removing your statuses.

**Useful:** the `Y-m-d H:i:s` format is the one used by MySQL for its `DATETIME`
type.

Now you should have a cleaner Model Layer containing:

* a DAL thanks to the `Connection` class;
* a Data Mapper to persist/remove Plain Old PHP Objects (POPO);
* a Finder to perform queries and retrieve sets of POPOs.


Filtering The Results
---------------------

At the moment, your API returns collections of resources. **But**, what if you
want to return the last 5 statuses? Or the statuses between two dates?

First of all, you need to understand how a client will perform a request for
such a use case:

    GET /statuses?limit=5&orderBy=createdAt

This literally means:

    Give me the last 5 statuses

If you decompose the URI, the client adds two parameters to the **query
string**: `limit` and `orderBy`.

* `limit` stands for _"number of results to return"_;
* `orderBy` is a criterion.

This criterion will be passed to the Model Layer, in order to fetch the results
the right way. In this example, the results in the database will be ordered by
date.

The SQL query will look like:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM statuses
ORDER BY created_at
LIMIT 0, 5
```

Your job is to modify your `Finder` to allow the use of criteria.

Your `find*()` methods need a `$criteria` parameter. This parameter will modify
the SQL queries by adding SQL clauses like `LIMIT`, `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`, and so
on.

You can write tests to prove everything works fine.

Now, update your controllers to allow filtering the results. It only makes sense
on collections. You should be able to:

1. limit the number of results;
2. order results by a given column and a given direction (`ASC` or `DESC`).

That's all folks!
