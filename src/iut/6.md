Practical Work #6 â€” The End!
============================

This is your last practical, hurray!
First of all, if you didn't see these tweets yet, it's worth reading them:

Authentication
--------------

Add an authentication layer as described in class.

1. Your users can be authenticated so that they can retrieve their own statuses,
   and create new ones with their names,
2. Only users can delete their own statuses,
3. It is still allowed to create new statuses **anonymously**.


Testing
-------

### Functional Tests

Functional tests are tests that ensure correctness of your application by
focusing on use cases/user stories.

#### User Stories vs Use Cases

Did I mention the difference between use cases, and user stories? I guess no.
According to Wikipedia (eurk), a **user story** _is one or more sentences in the
everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures
what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function_. Most of the
time, we use the following pattern to represent a user story:

    "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>"

According to Wikipedia, a **use case** _is a list of steps, typically defining
interactions between a role (known in UML as an "actor") and a system, to
achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or an external system._ It's more
formal, and verbose.

#### In-Depth With Functional Testing

The goal of functional testing is to not only test a method, but this method
and its interactions with the rest of the application. In other words, they
test the system the way the end user would use it.

For instance, you cannot test a controller because its job is to glue all
components of your application to fit a given use case. For example, a
controller relies on the Model layer to retrieve data, and uses the View layer
to render the data to the client.

You can write your first functional tests by testing your _Mapper_ using a
configured `Connection` instance (leveraging the SQLite database), instead of
using a mock.

``` php
<?php

class StatusDataMapperTest extends TestCase
{
    private $con;

    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->con = new \Model\Connection('sqlite::memory:');
        $this->con->exec(<<<SQL
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS statuses (
    ...
);
SQL
        );
    }

    public function testPersist()
    {
        $mapper = new \Model\StatusDataMapper($this->con);

        // ...

        // Example on how to count rows in the table
        // $rows = $this->con->query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM statuses')->fetch(\PDO::FETCH_NUM);
        // $this->assertCount(0, $rows[0]);
    }
}
```

Test your Model layer using SQLite.

Another part you may want to test is the API. It's a pain to use `curl` to test
each API method, and we don't do that in real life. Instead, give
[Goutte](https://github.com/fabpot/Goutte) a try. It is a simple PHP web
scrapper:

``` php
<?php

$client   = new Client();
$endpoint = 'http://localhost:8090';

// GET
$crawler  = $client->request('GET', sprintf('%s/statuses', $endpoint));
$response = $client->getResponse();

// POST
// See: https://github.com/symfony/BrowserKit/blob/master/Client.php#L242
$client->request('POST', sprintf('%s/statuses', $endpoint), $request, [], $headers, $content);

// Examples of assertions:
// $this->assertEquals(200, $response->getStatus());
// $this->assertEquals('text/html', $response->getHeader('Content-Type'));
//
// $data = json_decode($response->getContent(), true);
// $this->assertArrayHasKey('message', $data);
```

Test your API using this client. Your application has to run in order to test it.

You can also use [Behat](http://behat.org/) (and
[Mink](http://docs.behat.org/cookbook/behat_and_mink.html)) to describe
scenarios.
