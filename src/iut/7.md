Getting Started With Symfony
============================

Install the Symfony Standard Edition:

    $ mkdir ~/php
    $ composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition ~/php/my-app ~3.0

Note: feel free to change the project's name (a.k.a. `my-app` above).

You will be asked to fill in a few parameters such as the database credentials.
You can run a Docker image (cf. [Practical Work #5](https://github.com/willdurand-edu/php-practicals/blob/master/src/iut/5.md#practical-work-5)).

Ensure everything is working fine. Look at the VM configuration (or repository)
to get the URL of this web application in order to browse it.
Also, take a look at the [Symfony
documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html), it never hurts.
