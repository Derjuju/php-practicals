Getting Started With Symfony2
=============================

Start your VM:

    $ cd $DOCROOT
    $ git pull --rebase origin master
    $ vagrant up

Install the Symfony Standard Edition:

    vagrant@vm $ composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition sf2/ ~2.4

**Note:** the `sf2/` directory has not been randomly chosen ;-)

Ensure everything is working fine. Look at the VM configuration (or repository)
to get the URL of this web application in order to browse it.

Take a look at the [Symfony
documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html), it never hurts.

## What You Have To Do Now

Your job is to implement the web application you wrote in the previous
practicals, and to learn Symfony the hard way, meaning by hacking on it rather
than following a tutorial.

Create a bundle named: `LicwebStatusBundle`.

Your controllers have to extend the Symfony2 base `Controller`.

The **persistence layer** will use a `YAML` file. Put your file in the `cache`
directory. You can get its path with:

``` php
$path = $this->container->getParameter('kernel.cache_dir');
```

You won't use any templating engine. Either write your own template engine (like
the one you used in the last practicals, **or** manipulate strings in the
controller.
