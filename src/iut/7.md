Getting Started With Symfony2
=============================

Start your VM:

    $ cd $DOCROOT
    $ git pull --rebase origin master
    $ vagrant up

SSH into the VM:

    $ vagrant ssh

Then, install the Symfony Standard Edition:

    vagrant@vm $ rm -r /var/www/sf2
    vagrant@vm $ composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition /var/www/sf2/ ~2.6

**Note:** the `sf2/` directory has not been randomly chosen ;-)

Ensure everything is working fine. Look at the VM configuration (or repository)
to get the URL of this web application in order to browse it.
Also, take a look at the [Symfony
documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html), it never hurts.
