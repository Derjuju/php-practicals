Read It Later
=============

A **Read It Later** is an application for managing a reading list of articles
from the Internets™. In short, you can **save links** into an application that
you will **read**, well, **later**. Yet, most of the exisiting services added
features on top of it, such as:

* Offline mode: content is fetched and stored so that you don't need an Internet
connection to read your saved links;
* Comments/notes: say if you want to summurize the content of the link;
* Support for embedded videos;
* Categories: to sort all your links;
* Sharing (Twitter, Email, etc.).

There are many existing services, including:
[Instapaper](ttps://www.instapaper.com/), which [turns web content – articles,
stories, posts, videos, and even long emails – into a great reading
experience](https://www.instapaper.com/help),
[Pocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_\(application\)), formerly known
as Read It Later, and [Wallabag](https://www.wallabag.org/), the Open Source
alternative.

In order to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a Read It Later application
has to:

* save links a single user wants to _read later_;
* fetch the content of a link to enable offline mode (content has to be stored);
* provide the ability to sort links inot categories.

Fetching the content of a link SHOULD be done with a **worker**. A worker is a
special application that runs periodically (e.g., every _X_ minutes), and loops
over a set of tasks to perform. For instance, it can retrieve (from the
database) all links that have no content yet, and for each: (i) fetch the
content, and (ii) store it in the database.  The [Symfony Console
Component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html)
may help you.

Also, today's applications SHOULD be "API-oriented", that is built around an API
(HTTP/RESTful). Here, it would be nice to save links by sending a request with
`cURL` or [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie).

There are many other features that can be added to this application but here are
two interesting options:

* support multiple users (with account management);
* save a link using a bookmarklet.

**Advice:** give an existing application a try in case you never used any Read
It Later application.

What You Have To Do Now
-----------------------

Write a *Read It Later* application.

You can use whatever tool you want as far as you can explain your choices. You
MUST write the application in PHP. For instance, you can use
[Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/), or [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/)
as framework.

Rely on [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and
[Packagist](https://packagist.org) to install packages, and manage your
project's dependencies. You can ask for advices regarding the libraries you
would like to use.

Your code SHOULD be versioned. I don't mind if you loose your work before the
deadline ;-)

You MUST use the Coding Standards as described in
[PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and
[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). The [PHP Coding Standards
Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) could help you.

### The Model

**Important:** you MUST focus on the Model layer, and you MUST write this layer
yourself. No existing ORM allowed here. You MUST implement database design
patterns seen in class, but choose them carefully according to what you need to
do.

You can use a simple file as persistence storage, in YAML or JSON for instance.

If you want to use PDO, choose SQLite as database engine if you are running
your code on `etud`, otherwise feel free to use another database engine such as
PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Then again, be sure to be able to explain your choices.

### Testing

Software testing is a **requirement** for all developers. Your job is **not** to
write code, it is all about providing solutions for given problems. The right
solution is always the one that works.

The question is: how do you ensure that your solution works? You cannot rely on
the well-known _it works on my machine™_. This is just silly. What you need to
do is to provide a set of automated tests.

Tests are more than just _assertions_ on some properties of your application,
it is also the best documentation you can provide to your customers/users because
tests are always up to date.

So, your application MUST be tested. Write unit tests, but also functional
tests. [Behat](http://docs.behat.org/) can help you with your functional tests.
It takes sort of user stories as input ;-)

Don't expect to have more than _10/20_ if you don't provide tests!

### Presentation Layer

While it is not the goal of this project, things that look nice are always
better than ugly things, even if those things don't work. In oher words, don't
neglect the presentation/design.

### Hints

#### Content Negotiation

Content Negotiation is part of the HTTP protocol, used to serve a resource in
the best format for a client. You can read [RFC 2616:
HTTP/1.1](http://pretty-rfc.herokuapp.com/RFC2616) and [RFC 2295: content
negotiation](http://pretty-rfc.herokuapp.com/RFC2295) if you want more
information.

Content negotiation means that a single resource can be presented in different
ways, depending on the client preferences. To achieve this goal, **HTTP
headers** (`Accept`, `Accept-*`) are used by a client to tell the server about
its preferences.

Your application SHOULD be able to serve resources in:

* `HTML` using a template;
* `JSON` encoded data.

[Negotiation](https://github.com/willdurand/negotiation) can help you get the
best format from headers by handling content negotiation. The `Accept` header
**could** be found in `$_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT']`. It is possible to use
Negotiation with both [Silex](https://github.com/willdurand/StackNegotiation)
and [Slim](https://github.com/codeguy/Slim-Middleware).

Your implementation SHOULD accept parameters encoded in:

* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` - used when you submit a HTML form;
* `application/json`.

When a request has a body, it should provide a `Content-Type`. This content
type header is available in either `$_SERVER['HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE']` **or**
`$_SERVER['CONTENT_TYPE']`.

#### Serialization

HTML rendering is achieved through your template engine. Rendering your data in
other formats is called _serialization_. Serialization is the process of
converting a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored.

The serialization is handled by a Serializer. This serializer can be as simple
as the `json_encode()` function or you can use the [Serializer
Component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/serializer.html).


#### Bookmarklet

[Bookmarkets can be defined as mini applications masquerading as tiny snippets
of JavaScript awesomeness that reside in your browser and provide additional
functionalities, with just a
click](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-bookmarklets-the-right-way--net-18154).

Read It Later applications usually provide bookmarklets so that users just have
to click on them to save a page (_i.e._ a link) without having to open the
application, copy and paste the link, submit it.

Here is a simple snippet that can be put in a `a` HTML element:

``` javascript
javascript:location.href='http://example.org/save?url=' + encodeURIComponent(location.href)
```

Such a bookmarklet redirects the user to `http://example.org/save` page with the
URL has parameter (query string). The `/save` URI is something you have to
implement. Store the URL as you would usually do, but then, redirect the user to
the previous page (_i.e._ the URL given in the query string).

Important
---------

Le projet est à rendre au plus tard le **[TO BE DEFINED] à 23h59 CET**. Vous ne
pouvez pas être plus de deux étudiant(e)s sur un projet.

Les formats acceptés sont :

* une archive (`tar`, `tgz` ou `zip`) ;
* **ou** un dépôt distant (`git`, `svn`, etc.).

Le projet doit être accompagné d'instructions de mise en route. Ainsi que d'un
bilan rapide de ce qui a été fait/pas fait. Le format pour ce fichier doit être
**textuel**, donc `txt` ou `markdown`. Je ne peux pas ouvrir les fichiers Word
ou Open Office.

Ce bilan n'est pas un compte rendu formel, vous pouvez simplement énumérer ce
qui a été fait et ce qui n'a pas été fait, en faisant des phrases courtes, **en
français**. Il devrait tenir sur une page, et c'est un fichier **obligatoire**.

Aucun retard ou problème technique ne sera toléré, c'est pourquoi il est
fortement conseillé de mettre également à disposition un lien de téléchargement
direct sur un service en ligne (Dropbox, Ubuntu One, Google Drive, etc.).

Si votre archive est corrompue, vous serez défaillant, faites en sorte
d'envoyer quelque chose de correct. Nous vérifierons ce point à chaque
réception d'un projet. Si votre archive est corrompue, nous vous l'indiquerons
et vous aurez avant 23h59 pour renvoyer une archive valide.

Vous devez nommer l'archive comme suit : `projet_<nom 1>_<nom 2>.zip`. Le mail
doit comporter la mention `[ZZ3F2 PHP]` dans le sujet du mail.
